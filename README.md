# Track Your Expense - React Application

## Overview

This React application allows you to track your expenses with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It includes sorting capabilities (ascending, descending, and alphabetically) and uses local storage to persist data.

## Features

- **CRUD Functionality**: Add, view, edit, and delete expense items.
- **Sorting**: Sort expenses by amount (ascending/descending) and by name (alphabetically).
- **Local Storage**: Data is stored in local storage to persist between sessions.
- **Custom Hook**: A custom `useLocalStorage` hook is created and used to manage local storage interactions.
